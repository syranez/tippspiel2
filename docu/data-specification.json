     *
     * groups partitionate a tournament in separate pieces. You can define as
     * much groups as you like.
     *
     * Scored points in a group will stay in the group. Thus a team getting in the
     * next group starts with zero points.
     *
     * But you can nest groups. In a nested group points will be aggregated in the top group.
     * For example: You have a group "A" and a group "B". You want both groups "A" and "B" to have separate points,
     * but also the whole points an team made in both groups:
     *
     *    "top_group": {
     *        "A": {
     *            "name": "A"

     *        "B": {
     *            "name": "B"
     *        }
     *
     * In group "A" some team made 17 points, in "B" 16 points. In group "top_group" the team made 17 + 16 points => 33 points.
     *
     * Example for the German Bundesliga:
     *
     * "groups": {
     *     "Bundesliga": {
